# US Flight Data Analysis
## by Ahmed Salah


## Dataset

* The data set keeps record of the fligths info in the US airports in the period from 2010 to 2019 with 156000 record.

* It contains detailed information about the number of flights delayed, time delayed, reasons for delays and the contribution of each reason. 

* It also keeps record of the canceled and diverted flights in each month for each airport and carrier.



## Key Insights 

* The five main carriers are Southwest Airlines Co., Delta AirLines Inc., American Airlines Inc., SkyWest Arlines Inc., United Air Lines Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. are the first in the number of flights and they have high percentage of human contribution to delation.

* The order of the highest 5 carriers (in number of flights) didn't change across the last 10 years except for the American Airlines Inc. which had a big jump between 2014 and 2016 to advance from the 4th position to the third position with slight difference with the second carrier.

* Depending on one airport seems to correlate with delation time negativaly (depending on one airport give less delation time).

* Increasing the number of flights increases delation time. This seems to follow certain moods. Increasing the number of flights past one number will result on entering new mode from lower delation time again. Also the modes slope decrease the more flights you have.
