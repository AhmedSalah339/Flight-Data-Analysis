## Dataset

> The data set keeps record of the fligths info in the US airports in the period from 2010 to 2019 with 156000 record.

It contains detailed information about the number of flights delayed, time delayed, reasons for delays and the contribution of each reason. 

It also keeps record of the canceled and diverted flights in each month for each airport and carrier.

## Summary of Findings

> The distributions of the carrier contribution in delayed flights and the late air craft delation were almost he same. This suggests they are closely related. Hawaiian carrier was the worst in terms of number of flights and the contribution of the carrier in delayed time. Spirit Airlines happens to be the best in human related delation (economic class) but the number of flights they have is very low. THe biggest share of flights is concentrated in 5 carriers (65%) from total of 22 carrier. Their positions didn't change across the last 10 years except for the American Airlines Inc. which had a big jump between 2014 and 2016 to advance from the 4th position to the third position with slight difference with the second carrier. The first carrier is Southwest Airlines Co. which is far high from the other carriers. The carriers dependence on one main airport for their flights is variant. Genrally the contribution of the carriers in delation time is decreasing when the carriers concentrates on one main airport. The first 5 carriers are vary in their concentrating on main airports. The highest 5 carriers look to have different modes in the relation between the number of flights and the human contribution to delation. When the human error increase with the airflights some carriers handles the error with the high airflights rate which suggests expanding the compony at certain point of time. The first carrier has fixed range of human contribution to delayed flights with high flights number.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The five main carriers are Southwest Airlines Co., Delta AirLines Inc., American Airlines Inc., SkyWest Arlines Inc., United Air Lines Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. is the first in the number of flights and it has high percentage of human contribution to delation. The order of the highest 5 carriers (in number of flights) didn't change across the last 10 years except for the American Airlines Inc. which had a big jump between 2014 and 2016 to advance from the 4th position to the third position with slight difference with the second carrier. The best carriers with low human contribution to delation and high airflights are the carrier with the second position Delta AirLines Inc. and the one with the third position 'American Airlines Inc..
